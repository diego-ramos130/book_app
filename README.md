**Version**: 1.2.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application takes books stored in a database and renders their information on a page and can get details like description and ISBN on detailed view. It can also add books to the database using the new book form page. We're building it to eventually pull books from google books API at will and store them in a database, all to be deployable on something like a heroku app. Consider it a list of books!

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Clone the repository.
2. Host the website on a server, most likely using something like node or nodemon (npm i to download the packages).
